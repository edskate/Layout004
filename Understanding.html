    <h1>Understanding HTML & CSS.</h1>
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Can help anyone who works <br> with the web: <br>designers can create more attractive and usable sites. website editors can communicate whith their <br> audience more effectively,  <br>and managers can commission better sites and get the best out of their teams. <br>IÂ´ve focussed on the code you need to use 90% of the time and omitted the code that you would rarely see even if writing websites is your full time job. <br>By the end of book if you come across the other 10% <br> you will be able to Google it to find out what it meams quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I have also added practical <br> Information on topics I am <br> commonly asked about, such as <br> how to prepare images, audio <br> and video for the web , how to approach the design and build <br> of a new  site , how to improve your rankings in search engines (SEO). and how to use Google Analytics to learn about visitors to your site.</li>
