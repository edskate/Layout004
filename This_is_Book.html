    <h2>THE STRUCTURE OF THIS BOOK.</h2>
    <h3>In order to teach you about creating web pages, this book is divided into three sections.</h3>
    <p>1:HTML </p>

    <em>We will spend the first chapter <br> looking at how HTML is used to <br>create web pages. <br>you will see <br> that you start by writing down <br>the words you want to appear <br>on your page. <br>You then add tags or elements to the words so  that the browser knows  what  is a heading, <br>where a paragraph begins and ends and so on.<em>
