    <h1>IS IT HARD TO LEARN?</h1>
    <p>Many books that HTML and CSS <br> resemble dull manuals. <br> <em>To make it easier for you to learn, we threw away the traditional template used by publishers and redesigned this book from scratch.</em> <br> </p>
    <p>At work, when peolpe look <br>at my scree and see it full of <br>code, it´s not unusual to get a  comment about it looking very <br> complicated or how clever I must <br> be to understand it. <br> The truth <br> is, it´s not that hard to learn how to write web pages and read <br>the code used to create them, <br> you certainly don´t have to be a "programmer"</p>
